/* 
Have the function NUniqueCharacters(str) take the str parameter being passed
and find the longest substring that contains N unique characters, where N 
will be the first character from the string. The substring will start from the
second position in the string because the first character will be the integer N.
For example: if str is "2aabbacbaa" there are several substrings that all contain 
2 unique characters, namely: ["aabba", "ac", "cb", "ba"]. but your program should 
return "aabba" because it is the longest substring. If there are multiple longest 
substrings, then return the first substring encountered with the longest length, N
will range from 1 to 6
